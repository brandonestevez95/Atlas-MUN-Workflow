# Atlas MUN Workflows

Atlas is a standardized GIS + StoryMaps workflow for Model United Nations conferences.  
It was developed by **[Brandon Estevez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brandonestevez)** and **[Bernard Roach](https://www.linkedin.com/in/BERNIE_LINKEDIN)** for the CAPS Model United Nations Conference (CAPSMUN) and is designed to be **scalable**, **replicable**, and adaptable to other conferences.

This repository documents the *core* Atlas system: naming conventions, map-building workflows, and StoryMaps integration strategies.  

We are **strategically sharing the foundational structure** to support the growth of GIS in Model UN â€” while retaining certain internal operational assets (e.g., curated datasets, automation scripts, and implementation timelines) to preserve the competitive edge of CAPSMUN.

Atlas represents a fusion of geospatial expertise, debate strategy, and operational speed â€” refined through hands-on execution.

## ðŸ“– Behind the Scenes

We are preparing a StoryMap that will showcase the **behind-the-scenes process** of how Atlas was used to build CAPSMUNâ€™s GIS infrastructure â€” from raw data sourcing to fully interactive delegate maps.
